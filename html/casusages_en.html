                    <p>Starting from any "data point" (a field in a table, a table, a file, a schema), {openAudit}
                        allows you to understand its origin and usage, both on-premises and in the Cloud, through a
                        technical and multi-technological data lineage. The underlying analyses are replayed daily in an
                        automated manner.</p>

                    <p>Information about the scheduling of chains is available, and the usage of each "data point" is
                        defined on hover: who accesses what information, when, using which tools, which is of major
                        interest in a "compliance" context.</p>

                    <p>{openAudit} offers different graphical representation modes for its data lineage (business/IT).

                    <p>{openAudit} allows you to understand all data visualization technologies within the company on a
                        single impact analysis interface: it's a grid that helps understand the hierarchy between each
                        of the constituent elements of the dashboard and the physical source (or view), from the
                        dashboard cell to the query that queries the database, through the semantic layer if there is
                        one, etc.</p>

                    <p>Data lineage in the dashboard or in the data provisioning layers can be triggered from this
                        interface.</p>

                    <p>Thus, all internal rules of data visualization technologies are highlighted and shared with
                        everyone. This data lineage in the data visualization layer can be linked to data provisioning
                        lineage.</p>

                    <p>Some data visualization technologies use semantic layers to create understanding for business
                        users and give them autonomy. These semantic layers create abstraction: the underlying physical
                        fields are hard to identify, making sourcing complex.</p>

                    <p>In addition, data visualization technologies often query views, nested views, which further
                        complicates sourcing.</p>

                    <p>With the proliferation of data visualization technologies, performing multi-technological impact
                        analysis (or sourcing) is complex.</p>

            <p class="soustitreban">Data storage or data visualization technologies have accumulated over time.
                Some of these technologies have become outdated or are not well-suited for the Cloud. Migration is
                necessary.
                Unfortunately, the volumes and intrinsic complexity of some technologies make these projects excessively
                costly.
                {openAudit}, relying on the extreme granularity of its reverse engineering, enables the automation of

                    <h3><b>1) {oA-Reverse}-dataflows: Migrate Dataflow Technologies</b></h3>
                    <p>Migrating procedural language technologies is often so delicate that companies prefer to stack
                        technologies rather than decommission them.
                        However, they struggle to maintain these languages due to a lack of experts capable of reverse
                        engineering.</p>

                    <p>Today, the enthusiasm for the Cloud is changing this paradigm, and more and more companies are
                        looking to get rid of these legacy languages quickly, with no other solution than embarking on
                        risky and costly migrations.</p>

                    <b><u>Use Cases:</u></b>
                    <p>Changing DBMS, Cloud migration, maintaining a legacy system, etc.</p>

                    <p>Large companies have accumulated processing technologies for a long time. Continuous stacking
                        occurs because removing a technology often involves too many risks.
                        But the associated skills are becoming scarce, and retro-documentation is rarely in place.</p>

                    <p>At some point, companies need to take action! These can be consulting projects, long, costly, and
                        risky. We believe it's better to automate the process.</p>
